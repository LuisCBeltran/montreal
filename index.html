                        <p>Commonly acknowledged as the unofficial cultural capital of Canada, Montreal is the perfect fusion of past, present and future. From the cobblestone streets, historic architecture, and old world charm of Old Montreal to its vibrant and modern downtown, Montreal is characterized by a distinctly European “joie de vivre" attitude.</p>

                        <p>According to the QS Best Student Cities 2016 index, Montreal ranks first in North America and 7th worldwide among the best cities for students. It also ranks first in Canada for the number of university students per capita and is among the country's leading university research cities.</p>

                        <p>Montreal is known for its winters, which can seem harsh to those not used to the snow and the cold. But Montreal's charm doesn't falter with the changing of the seasons. It's a wonderful place to live year-round, offering activities and special events throughout the entire calendar year, even when the thermometer takes a dip.</p>

                        <p>Compared to many other major world cities, Montreal is a very safe place to live. Residents can go about their business with peace of mind. The rates for violent crime, already low for a major city like Montreal, have been steadily decreasing since 1990 and, according to The Economist's Safe Cities Index in 2016, Montreal is one of the safest cities in the world.</p>
